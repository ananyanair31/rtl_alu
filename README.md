# rtl_alu

## Overview
This project implements an **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)** as part of an **ASIC design** workflow. The ALU performs basic arithmetic and logic operations and is verified using a testbench.

## Features
- Supports operations like **addition, subtraction, AND, OR, XOR, and shift operations**.
- Designed using **Verilog**.
- Simulated and verified using **Vivado/Xilinx tools**.
- Synthesizable for ASIC implementation.
